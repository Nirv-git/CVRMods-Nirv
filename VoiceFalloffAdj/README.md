# ~~VoiceFalloffAdjMod~~
Outdated 9/17/2022 - Added to game

~~A simple mod that adds the ability to change the max voice distance for other players in a range from 1-14.5 meters. *The real max is 10meters, I assume as a bandwidth saving feature(?), however I have the slider max out at 14.5 so you can hear someone at that 10meter point)~~
~~The UI is the same as PortableMirror and is aligned not to conflict with it. In Melon Prefs you can change the position of the menu. (I recommend using https://github.com/sinai-dev/MelonPreferencesManager | For CVR use the Mono version)~~   
  * ~~QuickMenu Position (0=Right, 1=Top, 2=Left) - If the mirror menu is on the Left/Right/Top side of your QuickMenu~~
  * ~~Enabled color for QuickMenu items (0=Orange, 1=Yellow, 2=Pink)~~
