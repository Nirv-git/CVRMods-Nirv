# CVRCameraDontOverrender

Stops the Camera from over rendering your local player. Now you can see your hands when interacting with it!    

*Yes I know there is the experimental option to have your player overrender the UI, but that is the ENTIRE UI.*       

This toggle can be accessed from UIX/Melonprefs
