# RemoveChairs
Buttons to simply disable or enable active chairs in the world. (For those worlds covered in chair with no easy toggle to disable them)
_You understand that disabling stuff in a world can break stuff_ 
 
You can access the settings using BTKUI with the NirvMisc or default Misc page. (Toggle in MelonPrefs)
