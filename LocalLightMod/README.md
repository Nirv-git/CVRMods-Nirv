# LocalLightMod
Have you ever thought 'This world's lighting sucks' or 'Its too dark' well I have the solution for you! This mod lets you configure and spawn local (Spot|Point|Directional) light sources with near full customizability and provides functionality for saving and loading presets.
  
  Now you may think 'just use props!' and that is true, but sometimes you want more control or the world doesn't allow them.
  
You can access the settings using BTKUI with the NirvMisc or default Misc page. (Toggle in MelonPrefs)
