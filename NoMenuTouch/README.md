# NoMenuTouch
CVR be default allows you to 'touch' your MainMenu and QuickMenu as an input option, while neat this can result in unintentional inputs specially when you open your QuickMenu with your hands near each other.    
**This mod simply disables that feature with a toggle in UIX/MelonPrefs.**
