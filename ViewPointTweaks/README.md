# ViewPointTweaks
**[VR Only]**
This mod provides the ability to change your avatar's viewpoint position+rotation (really the camera) live in game, along with the much more niche feature of adjusting the scale of the VR camera to adjust it's 'IPD'.     
  
You can save these settings per avatar and have them autoload.   
 
You can access the settings using BTKUI with the NirvMisc or default Misc page. (Toggle in MelonPrefs)

The way this mod functions is a _tad_ hacky, it grew from an odd start.
