# PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn mirrors for themselves in any world.   

The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle between full/optimized/cutout or transparent
  * Configurable mirror size and distance from you
  * Standard, 45 degree, ceiling, and small mirrors
    
### Todo
  * Make the menu less ugly?


UI isn't the most pretty, but it works! And that is better than no UI. (And to answer why it is so far away from the QM, because the canvas for the QM is bigger then it looks and will eat interactions if you overlap it)

There are a few MelonPrefs that can be customized (I recommend using https://github.com/sinai-dev/MelonPreferencesManager | For CVR use the Mono version)   
  * QuickMenu Starts Maximized - Exactly as it says, default state of the mirror menu attached to your QuickMenu
  * QuickMenu Position (0=Right, 1=Top, 2=Left) - If the mirror menu is on the Left/Right/Top side of your QuickMenu
  * QuickMenu is smaller - Mirror menu is smaller (Mainly for Desktop)
  * Enabled Mirror Keybind - If you want the hell that is the keymap I made for it! [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81605232/184995574-2e2cc5a6-4265-4e1b-97e5-d7a5eb304519.png)
	
# VoiceFalloffAdjMod
A simple mod that adds the ability to change the max voice distance for other players in a range from 1-14.5 meters. *The real max is 10meters, I assume as a bandwidth saving feature(?), however I have the slider max out at 14.5 so you can hear someone at that 10meter point)

The UI is the same as PortableMirror and is aligned not to conflict with it. In Melon Prefs you can change the position of the menu. (I recommend using https://github.com/sinai-dev/MelonPreferencesManager | For CVR use the Mono version)   
  * QuickMenu Position (0=Right, 1=Top, 2=Left) - If the mirror menu is on the Left/Right/Top side of your QuickMenu

# NamePlateWithQMmod
Simple mod, this will enable/disable Nameplates when your QuickMenu is open, similar to VRC. 
There is a MelonPref that lets you disable this behavior.
 
'Show Nameplates' in CVR settings must be enabled
