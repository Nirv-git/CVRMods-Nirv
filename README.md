## PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn mirrors for themselves in any world.   

The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle between full/optimized
  * Configurable mirror size and distance from you
  * Standard, 45 degree, ceiling, and small mirrors
    
Transparent mirror is hopefully coming soonâ„¢

UI isn't the most pretty, but it works! And that is better than no UI. (And to answer why it is so far away from the QM, because the canvas for the QM is bigger then it looks and will eat interactions if you overlap it)

There are a few MelonPrefs that can be customized (I recommend using https://github.com/sinai-dev/MelonPreferencesManager | For CVR use the Mono version)
	* QuickMenu Starts Maximized - Exactly as it says, default state of the mirror menu attached to your QuickMenu
	* QuickMenu Position (0=Right, 1=Top, 2=Left) - If the mirror menu is on the Left/Right/Top side of your QuickMenu
	* QuickMenu is smaller - Mirror menu is smaller
	* Enabled Mirror Keybind - If you want the hell that is the keymap I made for it
