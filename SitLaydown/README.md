# SitLaydownMod
This mod is meant to reproduce some of the functionality for custom [Sit/Laydown animations that could be added to an avatar in VRC](https://github.com/Dervali-git/VRC-Tips/blob/main/LaySittingPrefab.md) for half body users, however I didn't want to figure out how to do it with avatar animators and am now abusing chairs!  Also this works on all avatars and I don't have to support people configuring it on their own one!

Current animations are, 'Lay down on back', 'Sit', 'Sit Crossed Legs', 'Sit Legs Down'

Pressing the toggle chair button will place you into a chair at your current location with the selected sitting animation. The movement controls lets you adjust the location of the chair object.

There are a few MelonPrefs that can be customized that aren't included on the menu.
  * Joystick movement multiplier (1-10)
  * Joystick rotation multiplier (1-10)
  * Prevent leaving the seat unless you use the menu or respawn - This keeps the big menu button from making you leave the seat. You must toggle off the seat in the Mod UI
  * Disables adjusting offsets 120 seconds after last adjustment - Will disable to 'Adjust Offsets' option for VR users 120 seconds after the last input.
