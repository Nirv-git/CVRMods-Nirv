# NoHeadShrinkMod
By default your local avatar's head is shrunk down to make it not visible in the normal first person camera.      

This mod adds options for disabling your local avatar's head from shrinking completely, or to auto un-shrink it if your camera is a certain distance from your avatar.     
**Functionality is disabled by default**   
This is a niche mod, but can be very useful in certain circumstances.     
           
Optional support for BTKUI with settings in the NirvMisc or default Misc page. (Toggle in MelonPrefs)
