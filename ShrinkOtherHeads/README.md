# ShrinkOtherHeads
 **Ultra niche mod** which gives the ability to shrink other player's head bones to 0.        
    
*This was made for use with the 'Control your Friends' Avatar which uses Limbgrabber to work.*    
(Requires my build of Limbgrabber due to [this](https://github.com/Exterrata/CVRMods/issues/1) issue.

This can be accessed from the Players menu from BTKUI.
